Increase stack/ Decrease Stack:

A stack with all values in it maintain a increasing/decreasing sequence.

Great for the situation when we need to find left and right closest element smaller/larger than the current in an array.

Problems 86 and 654 could make use of this.

86 is finding the smaller boundary, and 654 is finding the larger boundary, if constructed bottom-up.
